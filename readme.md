# ALiEN php framework with custom CMS #

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dominios/alien-framework.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dominios/alien-framework)

Alien is my custom implementation of MVC framework in PHP language. Framework is lightweight with only few components already implemented.

Together with this framework, implementation of simple CMS system is bundled as an example application. CMS is written as AngularJS application
and uses Alien framework as backend service, which provides needed API.

This project is currently in development together with wiki pages and API documentation.
